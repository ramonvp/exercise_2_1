# 6. What are the arguments of usb_cam-test.launch?

As shown by command:

```
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch --ros-args
```

This launch file does not accept any external argument. Not to get confused by the fact that node usb_cam needs several parameters, which are specified directly inside the launch file.
